//Name of the task: Use Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters

//task: Use destructuring assignment within the argument to the function half to send only max and min inside the function.

//solution:

const stats = {
    max: 56.78,
    standard_deviation: 4.34,
    median: 34.54,
    mode: 23.87,
    min: -0.75,
    average: 35.85,
};

const half = ({ max, min }) => (max + min) / 2.0;
